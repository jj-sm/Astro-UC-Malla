## About The Project

This is an app that has an interactive university curriculum for the degree in astronomy and physics at UC (Pontificic Catholic University of Chile). The original repository for this porject is located [here](https://github.com/loretito/malla-interactiva-uc). Then it was modified by me ([jj-sm](https://github.com/jj-sm)) adding new functionalities and adapting it to the Physics and Astronomy Curriculums
